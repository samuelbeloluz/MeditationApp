## 📕 About

**Meditation App** is a fictional iOS app designed to help users practice meditation. The app features a registration screen that was developed using UIKit, Auto Layout, and Constraints. During the development process, I focused on creating an intuitive user interface and a seamless user experience. I also faced several challenges, such as ensuring that the app was responsive across different screen sizes and optimizing the app’s performance.
